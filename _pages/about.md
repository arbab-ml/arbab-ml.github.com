Hi, I'm Muhammad Arbab Arshad. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Iowa State University (ISU). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Soumik Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-rmRjqIAAAAJ&hl=en). I draw huge insipration from the work of [Andrej Kapathy](https://karpathy.ai/). 

My research interests broadly include artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing, with a focus on domain specific applications. I am passionate about developing and applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems.
