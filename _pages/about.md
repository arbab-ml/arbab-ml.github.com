Hi, Iâ€™m Arbab Arshad. I am a Ph.D. student at the Iowa State University (ISU). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Soumik Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-rmRjqIAAAAJ&hl=en).
My research interests broadly include 3d computer vision and natural language processing. I like to build holistic understanding. like doing large scale software deployement and getting deep into machine learning models. I draw huge insipration from the work of [Andrej Kapathy](https://karpathy.ai/). By combining software and ML research experience, I aim to build AI that is both technically rigorous and practically impactful.

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
