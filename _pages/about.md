Hi, Iâ€™m Arbab Arshad. I am a Ph.D. student at the Iowa State University (ISU). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Soumik Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-rmRjqIAAAAJ&hl=en).
My research interests broadly include 3d computer vision and natural language processing. I like to build holistic understanding. like doing large scale software deployement and getting deep into machine learning models. I draw huge insipration from the work of [Andrej Kapathy](https://karpathy.ai/). By combining software and ML research experience, I aim to build AI that is both technically rigorous and practically impactful.
