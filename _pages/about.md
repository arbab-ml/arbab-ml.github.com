Hi, I'm Muhammad Arbab Arshad. I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Iowa State University (ISU). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Soumik Sarkar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-rmRjqIAAAAJ&hl=en). I draw huge insipration from the work of [Andrej Kapathy](https://karpathy.ai/). 

My research interests broadly include artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing, with a focus on agricultural applications. I am passionate about developing and applying advanced machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. My work spans from developing large language models for agriculture to evaluating neural radiance fields for 3D plant reconstruction.

Currently, I am a Research Assistant at the AI Institute for Resilient Agriculture (AIIRA) at Iowa State University, where I work on projects such as:

- Developing an Agricultural Large Language Model for precise recommendations
- Creating a 12-task agricultural benchmark to evaluate multimodal LLMs
- Evaluating Neural Radiance Fields for 3D plant reconstruction in field conditions

I have a strong background in software engineering and machine learning, with experience in cloud deployment, CI/CD pipelines, and various ML frameworks. I'm always eager to tackle challenging problems at the intersection of AI and practical applications.
